## Sponsorship

A specific role of **Sponsorship Coordinator** is required due to the intensity of the execution of offline and online campaigns.

Proper coordination with **Alumni Relations Officer**, **Social Media Manager**, **Media Manager**, and **Event Manager** are required in these tasks.

Sponsorships are required to get help from industries, Alumni, and prominent people who will help us in either providing equipment or with funds for traveling/accommodation when going for competitions.
