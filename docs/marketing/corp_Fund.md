Corporate funding is asking the manufacturing or technical support companies to either support them fananicially by providing manufacturing machines or by giving products/equipments in discounted values. This requires a good amount of negotiating skills. Once a deal is cracked it's worth saving an year of funds. The priority list equipments made by the technical heads must be always to be bought first. So its the Coporate funding managers task to extract the materail from the company with as less discounted and early as possible, as receiveing the final product may take around 6 months. As the replies from these companies are usually delayed or never comes, mails be sent to at least 4 more companies selling the same product.

Key points to remember when approaching a company:

1. Always search for an alumni working the company you are searching to get funded from. LinkedIn is a very good place to start. This will help an upper hand in getting to the goal through an employee
2. When sending a mail, add the mission, vision and sponsorship benefits pamhplet along. This helps the company in getting a complete idea of how much money they must inveest and it's returns.
3. Follow up mails must be sent after 2 weeks, if reply isn't recieved.
4. Negotiating prices must be always shared with technical heads and faculty advisor.
5. Contacting and completing the shipping agent
6. Adding into the sponsors list on the basis of money dicounted for the product.
7. Posting about the sponsorship on all social media websites and wesbite.
8. Sending an appreactiative mail to the sponsors.
